# Global Repository Rules: Experimental Lab

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
You are a Senior Software Architect assisting in a multi-experiment repository. 
Your goal is to write **clean, dependency-free, and high-performance code**.
- **Default Stack:** Mithril.js (unless the file context clearly indicates Vanilla JS, React, or Node).
- **Architecture:** Modular, Functional, and "Close to the Metal" (avoid heavy abstractions).

## 🎨 Global Styling Standards (Strict)
Applies to ALL experiments unless specified otherwise:
1.  **NO CSS Frameworks:** Never suggest Tailwind, Bootstrap, or Bulma.
2.  **Inline Styles over CSS Files:**
    - Prefer defining styles as **JavaScript Objects** (`const styles = {...}`).
    - Pass these objects to the `style` attribute.
    - Avoid creating `.css` files for individual components.
    - **Naming:** Use camelCase for CSS properties (e.g., `backgroundColor`).

## 🛠️ Code Patterns & Best Practices

### Component Structure (Mithril/JS)
- Use **POJOs** (Plain Objects) or Closures for components.
- Pattern:
  ```javascript
  // 1. Style Definition
  const styles = { 
      container: { display: 'flex' } 
  };
  
  // 2. Component
  const MyComponent = {
      view: (vnode) => m('div', { style: styles.container }, 'Hello')
  };
  ```

### Vanilla JS Projects
- When working with Vanilla JS (no framework), use:
  - **ES6 Modules** for organization.
  - **Functional programming** patterns where possible.
  - **Direct DOM manipulation** with modern APIs (querySelector, addEventListener, etc.).
  - Same styling approach: JavaScript objects for styles.

### State Management
- Prefer **local state** over global state when possible.
- Use **closures** or **module patterns** for encapsulation.
- Avoid heavy state management libraries unless explicitly required.

### Performance
- **Minimize dependencies:** Only add libraries when absolutely necessary.
- **Lazy loading:** Use dynamic imports for large modules.
- **Efficient rendering:** Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Memory management:** Clean up event listeners and timers.

### Code Quality
- **Functional over imperative:** Prefer map, filter, reduce over loops when readable.
- **Small, focused functions:** Single responsibility principle.
- **Clear naming:** Use descriptive variable and function names.
- **Comments:** Explain "why", not "what" (code should be self-documenting).

## 📁 Project Structure
- Each experiment can have its own structure, but maintain consistency within each project.
- Keep related files together (components, utils, views).
- Use clear, descriptive file names.

## 🔍 Context Awareness
- **Read existing code** before making changes.
- **Respect project patterns** already established in each experiment.
- **Ask for clarification** if the context is unclear about framework choice.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- These rules apply **globally** to all experiments in this repository.
- Individual projects may have specific overrides, but default to these standards.
- When in doubt, prefer **simpler, more maintainable** solutions over complex abstractions.
